**Filter Options Included:**

- Search across multiple fields
- Role-based filtering
- Status filtering (active/inactive/banned)
- Date range filtering (creation and activity dates)
- Activity status filtering
- Additional filters: avatar, locale, group, age range, coin range

**Predefined Filter Presets:**

- Recently Created Users
- Never Logged In Users
- Inactive Users
- Admin Users

### ✅ 3. Added bulk operation request/response types

**Key Interfaces:**

- `BulkOperationRequest` - Comprehensive bulk operation parameters
- `BulkOperationResult` - Detailed operation results with metrics
- `BulkOperationProgress` - Progress tracking for async operations
- `BulkOperationError` and `BulkOperationWarning` - Detailed error reporting
- `BulkOperationType` - Type-safe operation types

**Bulk Operations Supported:**

- ban/unban users
- activate/deactivate users
- delete users
- assign/remove roles
- export users
- send notifications
- reset passwords
- verify emails
- update locale
- merge accounts

**Enhanced Features:**

- Async operation support
- Batch processing options
- Progress tracking
- Detailed error reporting
- Performance metrics
- Audit logging support

### ✅ 4. Defined error code enums and error response interfaces

**Key Interfaces:**

- `ApiErrorResponse` - Enhanced error response with recovery suggestions
- `EnhancedApiErrorResponse` - Extended error response with severity levels
- `UserManagementErrorCodes` - Comprehensive error code enum
- `ErrorSeverity` - Error severity classification

**Error Categories:**

- User-related errors (not found, email exists, etc.)
- Permission errors (insufficient permissions, self-modification, etc.)
- Role-related errors (invalid role, assignment failures, etc.)
- Validation errors (format, length, required fields, etc.)
- Bulk operation errors (failures, timeouts, cancellations, etc.)
- System errors (database, network, rate limiting, etc.)
- Import/Export errors (file format, size, data validation, etc.)
- Feature-specific errors (email sending, notifications, etc.)

**Error Messages:**

- Complete error message mapping for all error codes
- User-friendly error messages
- Technical details for developers
- Recovery suggestions where applicable

## Additional Enhancements

- Request/response interfaces
- Batch operation support
- File upload interfaces
- Webhook payload types
- Health check responses
- Rate limiting interfaces
- Caching options
- Search interfaces

### ✅ Created Form-specific types (`src/types/forms.ts`)

- Form field configuration interfaces
- Validation rule interfaces
- Multi-step form support
- Form state management
- Predefined form configurations
- Validation utility functions
- Form field generators

### ✅ Created comprehensive type index (`src/types/index.ts`)

- Centralized type exports
- Type aliases for convenience
- Utility type helpers
- Common type combinations
- Component prop types
- Generic utility types

### ✅ Type Safety Enhancements

- Type guards for runtime type checking
- Transformation utilities between user types
- Field validation rules with type safety
- Constants with proper typing
- Enum-based type safety

### ✅ Backward Compatibility

- Maintained compatibility with existing auth system
- Updated existing files to use consolidated types
- Preserved existing API contracts
- Added type aliases for smooth migration
