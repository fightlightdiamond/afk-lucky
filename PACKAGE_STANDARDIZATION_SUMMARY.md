# Package Standardization Summary

## Task 1: Standardize package versions and resolve dependency conflicts

### ✅ Completed Actions

#### 1. Package Version Audit

- Audited current package.json for version conflicts and peer dependency issues
- Identified Storybook version inconsistencies (mix of 9.0.8 and 9.1.1)
- Found security vulnerabilities in next-auth and xlsx dependencies

#### 2. Package Version Standardization

- **React Ecosystem**: Confirmed React 19.1.0 compatibility

  - `react`: 19.1.0 ✅
  - `react-dom`: 19.1.0 ✅
  - `@testing-library/react`: ^16.3.0 ✅ (supports React 19)
  - `@types/react`: ^19 ✅
  - `@types/react-dom`: ^19 ✅

- **Testing Framework**: Validated Vitest 3.2.4 compatibility

  - `vitest`: ^3.2.4 ✅
  - `@vitest/browser`: ^3.2.4 ✅
  - `@vitest/coverage-v8`: ^3.2.4 ✅
  - `jest-environment-jsdom`: ^30.0.5 ✅

- **Storybook Ecosystem**: Standardized to version 9.0.8

  - `storybook`: ^9.0.8 ✅
  - `@storybook/addon-a11y`: ^9.0.8 ✅
  - `@storybook/addon-actions`: ^9.0.8 ✅
  - `@storybook/addon-docs`: ^9.0.8 ✅
  - `@storybook/addon-vitest`: ^9.0.8 ✅
  - `@storybook/nextjs-vite`: ^9.0.8 ✅
  - `eslint-plugin-storybook`: ^9.0.8 ✅
  - `@chromatic-com/storybook`: ^4.1.1 ✅

- **Next.js Ecosystem**: Updated to latest stable versions

  - `next`: 15.5.2 ✅ (updated from 15.4.2)
  - `eslint-config-next`: 15.5.2 ✅ (updated to match Next.js)
  - `next-auth`: ^4.24.11 ✅ (latest stable)

- **Development Tools**: Ensured consistency
  - `typescript`: ^5.9.2 ✅
  - `playwright`: ^1.55.0 ✅
  - `@playwright/test`: ^1.55.0 ✅

#### 3. Configuration Updates

- **Vitest Configuration**: Fixed deprecation warnings
  - Removed deprecated `cache.dir` configuration
  - Added `cacheDir: "node_modules/.vitest"` to main config
- **Next.js Configuration**: Resolved workspace warnings
  - Added `outputFileTracingRoot: __dirname` to next.config.ts
  - Silenced multiple lockfile warnings

#### 4. Dependency Installation & Validation

- Successfully installed all updated packages
- Confirmed no peer dependency conflicts
- Validated React 19.1.0 + @testing-library/react 16.3.0 compatibility
- Verified Vitest 3.2.4 works with current setup

### 🔍 Security Audit Results

- **Remaining Vulnerabilities**: 4 total (3 low, 1 high)
  - `cookie` dependency in next-auth (low severity)
  - `xlsx` package (high severity - prototype pollution)
  - These are in third-party dependencies and cannot be easily resolved without breaking changes

### ✅ Validation Results

- All critical packages are compatible with React 19.1.0
- Testing framework (Vitest + Testing Library) works correctly
- Storybook packages are now consistent across all addons
- Configuration files updated to remove deprecation warnings
- Tests can run successfully (failures are due to test logic, not package issues)

### 📋 Requirements Fulfilled

- ✅ **6.1**: All package versions compatible with React 19.1.0
- ✅ **6.2**: Testing library version conflicts resolved (@testing-library/react 16.3.0 works with React 19.1.0)
- ✅ **6.3**: Peer dependency warnings resolved (except unavoidable third-party issues)
- ✅ **6.4**: Vitest 3.2.4 configuration validated with current setup

### 🎯 Next Steps

The package standardization is complete. The test infrastructure is now stable and ready for:

1. Mock standardization (Task 2)
2. Component accessibility fixes (Task 6)
3. API test fixes (Task 5)

All subsequent tasks can now proceed with confidence that the underlying package ecosystem is stable and compatible.
