# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical issues with unit tests, code inconsistencies, and technical debt in the admin user management system. The system currently has 103 failed tests out of 289 total tests due to mock mismatches, import errors, component accessibility issues, inconsistent API interfaces, and package version conflicts that need to be systematically resolved with a comprehensive approach to prevent infinite error loops.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all mock imports to match actual exports, so that tests can properly simulate dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests import `createAbilityForUser` THEN it SHALL be changed to `createAbility` to match the actual export
2. WHEN tests mock `@/lib/ability` THEN the mock SHALL include all exported functions
3. WHEN API tests run THEN all mocked dependencies SHALL have correct function signatures
4. WHEN running import tests THEN no "No export is defined" errors SHALL occur

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component tests to find elements correctly, so that UI interactions can be properly tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing UserDialog component THEN form elements SHALL have proper accessibility labels
2. WHEN testing role selection THEN combobox elements SHALL be findable by role and name
3. WHEN testing form submission THEN all form fields SHALL be accessible via proper selectors
4. WHEN testing component rendering THEN text content SHALL match expected values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API tests to pass consistently, so that backend functionality is validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing admin API endpoints THEN authentication mocks SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN testing user import/export THEN file handling mocks SHALL be properly configured
3. WHEN testing bulk operations THEN database transaction mocks SHALL simulate real behavior
4. WHEN testing permissions THEN ability checks SHALL be properly mocked

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all 103 failing tests to pass, so that the codebase has reliable test coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm test` THEN all 289 tests SHALL pass without errors
2. WHEN fixing mock issues THEN existing passing tests SHALL continue to pass
3. WHEN updating component tests THEN accessibility requirements SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN resolving API test failures THEN error handling scenarios SHALL be properly tested

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent test patterns across all test files, so that maintenance is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new tests THEN they SHALL follow established mock patterns
2. WHEN testing components THEN they SHALL use consistent accessibility selectors
3. WHEN testing APIs THEN they SHALL use standardized mock setups
4. WHEN testing hooks THEN they SHALL properly mock external dependencies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized package versions and dependencies, so that version conflicts don't cause test failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN all package versions SHALL be compatible with each other
2. WHEN using testing libraries THEN versions SHALL be aligned (React 19.1.0, @testing-library/react 16.3.0, vitest 3.2.4)
3. WHEN importing dependencies THEN peer dependency warnings SHALL be resolved
4. WHEN building the project THEN no version conflict errors SHALL occur

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper code structure and architecture, so that components, tests, and stories are maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing components THEN they SHALL follow consistent folder structure and naming conventions
2. WHEN writing tests THEN they SHALL be co-located with components or in organized test directories
3. WHEN creating Storybook stories THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns and be properly typed
4. WHEN implementing features THEN code SHALL follow established patterns and best practices

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging tools, so that test failures can be quickly diagnosed and fixed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests fail THEN error messages SHALL be clear and actionable
2. WHEN debugging tests THEN proper logging and debugging tools SHALL be available
3. WHEN running test suites THEN performance metrics SHALL be tracked
4. WHEN fixing issues THEN changes SHALL be validated against regression tests

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated quality gates, so that code quality is maintained and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN committing code THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL run tests and linting
2. WHEN merging code THEN all tests SHALL pass and coverage SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN deploying THEN build process SHALL validate all components and stories
4. WHEN refactoring THEN automated tests SHALL catch breaking changes
