# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing admin user management system to provide comprehensive CRUD operations, advanced search and filtering capabilities, user account management (ban/unban), and role assignment functionality. The system will be built upon the existing Prisma schema, Next.js API routes, and React components, following the current architectural patterns and best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced User CRUD Operations

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to perform complete CRUD operations on user accounts, so that I can effectively manage all user data and maintain system integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a new user THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields (email, first_name, last_name, password)
2. WHEN an admin creates a user with an existing email THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
3. WHEN an admin updates a user THEN the system SHALL allow partial updates without requiring password changes
4. WHEN an admin deletes a user THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion of their own account
5. WHEN an admin views user details THEN the system SHALL display all relevant user information including role and permissions
6. WHEN performing any CRUD operation THEN the system SHALL check appropriate permissions using CASL ability system

### Requirement 2: Advanced Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to search and filter users by multiple criteria, so that I can quickly find specific users or groups of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin enters search text THEN the system SHALL search across user names, emails, and other relevant fields
2. WHEN an admin applies role filter THEN the system SHALL show only users with the selected role
3. WHEN an admin applies status filter THEN the system SHALL show only active or inactive users
4. WHEN an admin applies date range filter THEN the system SHALL show users created within the specified period
5. WHEN multiple filters are applied THEN the system SHALL combine them using AND logic
6. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text
7. WHEN no results match the criteria THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state

### Requirement 3: Sorting and Pagination

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to sort users by different criteria and navigate through paginated results, so that I can efficiently browse large user datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin clicks a column header THEN the system SHALL sort users by that column
2. WHEN an admin clicks the same column header twice THEN the system SHALL reverse the sort order
3. WHEN users are sorted THEN the system SHALL display sort indicators (arrows) in column headers
4. WHEN there are many users THEN the system SHALL implement pagination with configurable page sizes
5. WHEN navigating pages THEN the system SHALL maintain current filters and sort settings
6. WHEN page size is changed THEN the system SHALL reset to the first page

### Requirement 4: User Account Management (Ban/Unban)

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to ban and unban user accounts, so that I can control user access to the system without permanently deleting accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin bans a user THEN the system SHALL set is_active to false and record the action
2. WHEN an admin unbans a user THEN the system SHALL set is_active to true and record the action
3. WHEN a banned user tries to login THEN the system SHALL prevent access and show appropriate message
4. WHEN viewing user list THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate banned/active status with visual indicators
5. WHEN performing ban/unban actions THEN the system SHALL require appropriate permissions
6. WHEN an admin tries to ban themselves THEN the system SHALL prevent the action

### Requirement 5: Role Assignment and Management

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to assign and modify user roles, so that I can control user permissions and access levels throughout the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin assigns a role to a user THEN the system SHALL update the user's role_id field
2. WHEN an admin removes a role from a user THEN the system SHALL set role_id to null
3. WHEN viewing user details THEN the system SHALL display current role and associated permissions
4. WHEN assigning roles THEN the system SHALL only show roles that exist in the database
5. WHEN role assignment changes THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect permission changes
6. WHEN displaying users THEN the system SHALL show role information with permission badges

### Requirement 6: Bulk Operations

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to perform bulk operations on multiple users, so that I can efficiently manage large groups of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin selects multiple users THEN the system SHALL enable bulk operation mode
2. WHEN in bulk mode THEN the system SHALL provide options for bulk ban, unban, role assignment, and deletion
3. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL show confirmation dialogs with operation details
4. WHEN bulk operations complete THEN the system SHALL show success/failure summary
5. WHEN bulk deleting users THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion if current admin is included
6. WHEN selecting all users THEN the system SHALL provide select all/none functionality

### Requirement 7: User Activity Tracking

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view user activity information, so that I can monitor user engagement and identify inactive accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing user list THEN the system SHALL display last login date for each user
2. WHEN a user has never logged in THEN the system SHALL display "Never" for last login
3. WHEN viewing user details THEN the system SHALL show comprehensive activity information
4. WHEN sorting by activity THEN the system SHALL handle null values appropriately
5. WHEN filtering by activity THEN the system SHALL provide date range options

### Requirement 8: Data Export and Import

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to export user data and import bulk user data, so that I can perform data analysis and bulk user creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin exports users THEN the system SHALL generate CSV/Excel files with filtered data
2. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive information like passwords
3. WHEN importing users THEN the system SHALL validate data format and required fields
4. WHEN import validation fails THEN the system SHALL show detailed error messages
5. WHEN importing successfully THEN the system SHALL show summary of created/updated users
6. WHEN importing duplicate emails THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts according to admin preferences

### Requirement 9: Responsive Design and Accessibility

**User Story:** As an admin using various devices, I want the user management interface to be responsive and accessible, so that I can manage users from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive table layouts
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support all operations via keyboard
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
4. WHEN viewing on small screens THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential information
5. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback

### Requirement 10: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As an admin managing large user datasets, I want the system to perform efficiently, so that I can work without delays or timeouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading user lists THEN the system SHALL implement efficient pagination and lazy loading
2. WHEN searching users THEN the system SHALL debounce search input to reduce API calls
3. WHEN filtering data THEN the system SHALL use optimized database queries
4. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
5. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL use TanStack Query for optimal cache management
6. WHEN updating users THEN the system SHALL optimistically update the UI

### Requirement 11: Testing and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the user management system, I want comprehensive tests and documentation, so that I can ensure code quality and facilitate future development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN the system SHALL have integration tests for all CRUD operations
3. WHEN building UI components THEN the system SHALL have Storybook stories for all major components
4. WHEN testing user interactions THEN the system SHALL have end-to-end tests for critical workflows
5. WHEN components are documented THEN the system SHALL provide interactive examples in Storybook
