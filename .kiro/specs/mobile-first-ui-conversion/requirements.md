# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves converting the entire project interface from desktop-first to mobile-first design approach. The conversion will ensure optimal user experience across all device sizes, with mobile devices being the primary design target and desktop being progressively enhanced.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the interface to be optimized for my device screen size, so that I can easily navigate and interact with all features without horizontal scrolling or difficult touch targets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on a mobile device THEN the interface SHALL display optimally without horizontal scrolling
2. WHEN a user interacts with touch targets THEN they SHALL be at least 44px in size for comfortable touch interaction
3. WHEN content is displayed on mobile THEN text SHALL be readable without zooming
4. WHEN navigation is accessed on mobile THEN it SHALL be easily accessible through touch gestures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the interface to adapt responsively to my screen size, so that I get the best possible experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport width changes THEN the layout SHALL adapt smoothly using CSS breakpoints
2. WHEN content is viewed on tablet devices THEN it SHALL utilize the available space efficiently
3. WHEN accessed on desktop THEN the interface SHALL progressively enhance to use larger screen real estate
4. WHEN images and media are displayed THEN they SHALL scale appropriately for each device size

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want navigation to be intuitive and accessible, so that I can easily move between different sections of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation is accessed on mobile THEN it SHALL use a hamburger menu or bottom navigation pattern
2. WHEN menu items are displayed THEN they SHALL be easily tappable with appropriate spacing
3. WHEN sub-menus exist THEN they SHALL be accessible through mobile-friendly interactions
4. WHEN navigation state changes THEN it SHALL provide clear visual feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user managing data (users, roles, etc.), I want tables and data displays to work well on mobile, so that I can perform administrative tasks on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tables are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL use responsive patterns like card layouts or horizontal scrolling
2. WHEN data actions are available THEN they SHALL be accessible through mobile-friendly controls
3. WHEN filtering or searching data THEN the controls SHALL be optimized for touch interaction
4. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN they SHALL work efficiently on mobile devices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user filling out forms, I want form inputs to be mobile-optimized, so that I can easily complete tasks on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form fields are displayed THEN they SHALL have appropriate input types for mobile keyboards
2. WHEN forms are submitted THEN validation messages SHALL be clearly visible on mobile
3. WHEN multi-step forms exist THEN progress SHALL be clearly indicated on mobile
4. WHEN form controls are used THEN they SHALL be sized appropriately for touch interaction

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mobile-first approach to be implemented systematically, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS is written THEN it SHALL follow mobile-first media query patterns (min-width)
2. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL be designed mobile-first with progressive enhancement
3. WHEN breakpoints are used THEN they SHALL follow a consistent system across the application
4. WHEN responsive utilities are needed THEN they SHALL be available through the design system

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive elements to work well with touch, so that I can efficiently use the application on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL have adequate touch targets and spacing
2. WHEN hover states exist THEN they SHALL be adapted appropriately for touch devices
3. WHEN drag and drop functionality exists THEN it SHALL work with touch gestures
4. WHEN modal dialogs are shown THEN they SHALL be optimized for mobile interaction

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly on mobile networks, so that I can use it efficiently even with slower connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN critical CSS SHALL be inlined for faster rendering
2. WHEN images are loaded THEN they SHALL be optimized for different screen densities
3. WHEN JavaScript is loaded THEN it SHALL be optimized for mobile performance
4. WHEN fonts are loaded THEN they SHALL not block rendering on mobile devices
