# Test Performance Optimization Report

## Current Performance Metrics

- Total Duration: ~27 seconds
- Environment Setup: 27.77s (very high)
- Test Collection: 22.78s (high)
- Setup Time: 10.79s (high)
- Actual Test Execution: 63.71s

## Identified Performance Issues

### 1. High Environment Setup Time (27.77s)

- **Issue**: DOM environment setup is taking too long
- **Solution**: Optimize test environment configuration

### 2. Slow Test Collection (22.78s)

- **Issue**: Test discovery is slow, likely due to complex imports
- **Solution**: Optimize imports and reduce dependency loading

### 3. High Setup Time (10.79s)

- **Issue**: Mock setup and test utilities are expensive
- **Solution**: Lazy load mocks and optimize setup functions

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Optimize Test Configuration

- Use lighter test environment for unit tests
- Implement test sharding for parallel execution
- Optimize vitest configuration

### 2. Mock Optimization

- Lazy load heavy mocks
- Use shared mock instances
- Optimize Prisma mock setup

### 3. Import Optimization

- Reduce unnecessary imports in test files
- Use dynamic imports where possible
- Optimize test utility imports

### 4. Test Parallelization

- Enable parallel test execution
- Optimize test isolation
- Use worker threads effectively

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Vitest Configuration Optimization

- Enabled parallel execution
- Optimized test environment
- Reduced setup overhead

### 2. Mock Performance Improvements

- Shared mock instances
- Lazy loading of heavy dependencies
- Optimized Prisma mock setup

### 3. Test Utility Optimization

- Reduced import overhead
- Optimized helper functions
- Improved test isolation

## Performance Targets

- Target total execution time: < 15 seconds
- Target environment setup: < 5 seconds
- Target test collection: < 5 seconds
- Target setup time: < 3 seconds

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. Consider test sharding for large test suites
2. Implement test result caching
3. Use lighter alternatives for heavy dependencies in tests
4. Consider splitting integration tests from unit tests
5. Implement test-specific mock strategies
